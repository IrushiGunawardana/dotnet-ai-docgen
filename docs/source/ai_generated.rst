 In the given C# code, the `Calculator` class is a simple mathematical calculator that performs addition and multiplication operations. Here's a breakdown of each method:

1. `Add(int a, int b)`
   - Purpose: This method adds two integers and returns the sum.
   - Parameters:
     - `a`: The first integer to be added.
     - `b`: The second integer to be added.
   - Return Value: The sum of the input integers.
   - Example Usage:
     - `Calculator calculator = new Calculator();`
     - `int result = calculator.Add(2, 3);` // result is 5

2. `Multiply(int x, int y)`
   - Purpose: This method multiplies two integers and returns the product.
   - Parameters:
     - `x`: The first integer to be multiplied.
     - `y`: The second integer to be multiplied.
   - Return Value: The product of the input integers.
   - Example Usage:
     - `Calculator calculator = new Calculator();`
     - `int result = calculator.Multiply(2, 3);` // result is 6

This `Calculator` class is a basic example and can be expanded with more functions or optimized based on the specific requirements of your project.
